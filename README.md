## Editing outside of the game

You can edit macros outside of the game by editing the World of Warcraft\WTF\Account\<account name>\macros-cache.txt and
..\Account\<account name>\<server name>\<char name>\macros-cache.txt files, containing account-wide and per-character
macros respectively. Note that the macros should probably be numbered starting with 1 and continue to 36 on the
account-wide macros; and starting with 16777217 and continue to 16777234 for your character-specific macros. They don't
need to be in order from the beginning of the file. It is probably best to save at least one account-wide and one
character-specific macro in the game before you create your own macro file, to be familiar with macro file structure and
to be sure of the numbering of macros. When editing your macros outside the game, be sure to use a simple text editor
that can save in the unicode file format, otherwise you may run into formatting/character issues. These macros and their
bindings reflect my preferred ergonomics. It took me a few years to get used to them, but now it is fully engrained as
muscle memory. Like Emacs keymap I can spend years away but my fingers automatically know where to go when I am back.
